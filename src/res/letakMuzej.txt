Public institution Museum of Contemporary Art of Republic of Srpska is a central museum institution for performance 
of museum activities in the Republic of Srpska.

Following a decision of the Banja Luka Town Council, 
the Museum of Contemporary Art of the Republic of Srpska was founded on 13 January 1971 and initially named 
the Art Gallery of Banja Luka. A campaign preceded the opening of the Gallery, launched by Yugoslavian and international fine artists,
as a gesture of solidarity with the city of Banja Luka after it was hit by a massive earthquake on 26 and 27 October 1969. 
In solidarity with the devastated city, distinguished Yugoslavian painters, art historians and friends of Banja Luka collected around
800 art works to help the city, which were used to start the Gallery and made its core collection.
